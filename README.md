## Problem Descriptions

1. **Valid Parentheses**: Determine if a given string of parentheses is valid.
2. **Merge Two Sorted Lists**: Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.
3. **Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String**: Implement `strStr()` to find the first occurrence of a substring in a string.
4. **N-Queens**: Solve the N-Queens puzzle by placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
5. **Sqrt(x)**: Compute and return the square root of a non-negative integer.
6. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted List**: Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list.
7. **Binary Tree Inorder Traversal**: Perform inorder traversal on a binary tree.
8. **Find Peak Element**: Find a peak element in an array where an element is greater than its neighbors.
9. **Largest Number**: Arrange a list of non-negative integers to form the largest possible number.
10. **Bitwise AND of Numbers Range**: Compute the bitwise AND of all numbers in a given range.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the C++ programs:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gdcmadhav2004/DAA-Holiday-assignment-165.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd DAA-Holiday-assignment-165
   ```

3. **Compile a specific program**:

   ```bash
   g++ -o output_file_name source_file_name.cpp
   ```

   *Example*:

   ```bash
   g++ -o valid_parentheses 20_valid-parentheses.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the compiled program**:

   ```bash
   ./output_file_name
   ```

   *Example*:

   ```bash
   ./valid_parentheses
   ```

*Note*: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed, such as `g++`.
